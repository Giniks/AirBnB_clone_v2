## Project Overview

## Requirements

- Pycodestyle

- MySQL 8.0 and SQLAlchemy 1.4.x

- Environment variables such as HBNB_ENV, HBNB_MYSQL_USER, HBNB_MYSQL_PWD, HBNB_MYSQL_HOST, HBNB_MYSQL_DB, HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE

## Python Scripts

These scripts are classes and methods for different functionalities. Proper documentation is provided within the code.

## Python Unit Tests

These tests are important to ensure the codes work perfectly well. We used the unittest module to create and run the tests. They are organized in the same structure as the project.

### To run all tests:
```
python3 -m unittest discover tests
```

## SQL Scripts

SQL Scripts are made available in the script/Folder. These scripts interact with the MySQL database and are executed on 20.04 LTS using MySQL 8.0.


## Getting Started

- Clone the Repository

- Set up your MySQL database with the required environment variables. 

- Run the SQL scripts in the scripts/Folder to create the necessary tables.

- Execute the Python scripts to interact with the codebase.
