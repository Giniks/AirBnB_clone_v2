Project Overview

In this Project we will fork an existing codebase including making vairous changes/updates and improvements. This basics is to learn about unit testing, handling various storage engine and working environment variables.


Background Context

We are going to work in an existing codebase that raise questions and require updates. We will decify the codes without necessarily rewriting everything.

Requirements

- Implementing Pycodestyle

- Installing MySQL 8.0 and SQLAlchemy 1.4.x

- Implementing Environment variables such as HBNB_ENV, HBNB_MYSQL_USER, HBNB_MYSQL_PWD, HBNB_MYSQL_HOST, HBNB_MYSQL_DB, HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE

Folder and File Structure

- `models/`: Contains python classes that represent objects and their interractions.

- `tests/`: Contains Unit Tests for various modules.

- `scripts/`: SQL scripts to set up anf interract with MySQL database.

- `README.md`: This documentation file.

Python Scripts

These scripts classes and methods for different functionalities. Proper documentation is provided within the code.

Python Unit Tests.

This tests are important to ensure the codes works perfectly well. We used the unittest module to create and run the tests. They are organised in the same structure as the project.

To run all tests:
```bash
python3 -m unittest discover tests

SQL Scripts

SQL Scripts are made available in the script/Folder. This scripts interract with the MySQL database and are executed on 20.04 LTS using MySQL 8.0.


Getting Started

- Clone the Repository

- Set up your MySQL database with the required environment variables. 

- Run the SQL scripts in the scripts/Folder to create the necessary tables.

- Execute the python scripts to interract with the codebase.
